Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over Part of me believing it was always something that I'd done But I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough And you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Now you're just somebody that I used to know I used to know That I used to know I used to know Somebody

Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck Some nights I call it a draw Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle Some nights I wish they'd just fall off But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for What do I stand for, what do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know anymore This is it boys, this is war What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already? I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering Just who I am, who I am, who I am Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm Some nights I wish that this all would end Cause I could use some friends for a change And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again Some nights I always win, I always win But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for What do I stand for, what do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know Oh come on So this is it? I sold my soul for this? Washed my hands of that for this? I miss my mom and dad for this? No, when I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on Oh, come on Oh, come on Oh come on Well, that is it guys, that is all Five minutes in and I'm bored again Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks at home I'm sorry to leave, mom, I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone All dried up in the desert sun? My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called "love" But when I look into my nephew's eyes Man, you wouldn't believe The most amazing things That can come from Some terrible lie The other night, you wouldn't believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up, but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance
